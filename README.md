# Survival

A CLI-based survival game

## Overview

This is a hobby project that I made in order to practice my programming skills. The program is written in Python.

## Game Rules

In this game the player encounters a mutant animal that attacks the player. The player must respond by picking an action from a list of possible actions. If the player chooses the correct action they survive the encounter. The player gets one point for each encounter they survive. If the player chooses the wrong action they do not survive and the game ends. The player needs to get 25 points to win the game.

## Project Structure

The project root directory contains two directories:

1. `/game_objects` contains the Player and Animal class definitions as well as files that contain functions related to the classes. There is an Animal base class and three Animal subclasses.

1. `/utilities` contains the constants, dictionaries and lists used in the game.

The `main.py` file in the root directory calls the functions that make the game run.

## Get the Project
